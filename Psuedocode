## Psuedocode for the drone


## Algorithm organization
  ## Finite state machine
    # States: Start(), Tracking(), AprilTagNotDetected(), Land()
    
  ## Interrupt threads


## Start
  # Check battery life
  # If battery life is low
    # Cancel startup

  # Confirm sensors operational
  # Initialize sensors and camera
  # Confirm motors are operational
     
  #Zero altitude sensor
  
  #Check proximity sensors for nearby obstacles
  # If there are nearby obstacles
    # Shut down and end program
  
  #Rise to predetermined altitude
  
  # Detect april tag
  
  # If April is detected
    # Go to Tracking state
  # Else
    # Go to AprilTag not detected state
    
  
## Tracking
  #Detect april tag
  #Ground robot tracking
  #Check battery life to determine when to begin landing procedure
  #Rotate in direction of movement
  #Check proximity sensors to determine if clear to move in goal direction
  #If clear: 
    Move to april tag location (speed porpotional to distance from goal position)
  #If obscured: 
    Obstacle avoidance procedure
    
## AprilTagNotDetected
  # For 20 seconds
    # Hold position
    # Search for AprilTag
    
    # If battery is low
      # Go to landing state
    # Else/If AprilTag is detected
      # Go to Object Tracking State/Collision Avoidance State
  # Go to landing state
    
      

## Shutdown
  // Checking for nearby obstacles probably isn't necessary since we just use a straight descent
  # Check for nearby obstacles
  # While there are nearby obstacles
    # Move 90 degrees around the ground robot
    # Check for nearby obstacles
    # Break once one full revolution is complete
    
  # Check for safe distance to ground robot
  # If drone is above ground robot
    # Move X.Xm away from the ground robot
  
  # Enter descent loop
    # Decrease altitude
    
    # Check for safe distance to ground robot
    # If drone is above ground robot
      # Move X.Xm away from the ground robot
    
    # Check altitude
    # If below certain altitude
      # Break
       
  # Ramp down motors
  # Shut off motors
  # Shut off sensors and other equipment
  # Terminate Program
